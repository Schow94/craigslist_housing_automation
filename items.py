Please send me a message with any questions or a little about yourself. Perhaps a social media link. We are trying to find someone mid 20-30 with a similar mindset.. We are just normal people trying to make it in this expensive city.

I can connect you to a leasing agent whom markets the units.\n\nA little bit about myself: I am a student, currently working towards getting my Masters degree. I love music and collecting vinyl. I work as a Chef for Bon Appetit here in the city and am doing side projects as well. I work hard and love giving back to the community through my skills.\n\nLocation: The apartment is located 10 minutes from downtown and is close to really nice cafes, pizzerias, corner stores, Walgreens, CVS, and bus lines. Plus, on Wednesday and Friday there is a farmers market :)\n\nIf you have any questions or would like to view the space let me know. The photos are of the space when it is empty.

Move in is by July 1st but the room can be ready in a couple days.\n\nThe House: Four-bedroom, two-bath, two-story house in Ingleside. With large full kitchen, living room, dining room and large backyard (with BBQ and seasonal vegetable garden), plus garage with storage space and washer and dryer.\n\nThe Location: On Miramar, near Grafton/Holloway. Close to considerable public transit. The 29, 54 and K Muni are all within two blocks of the house, and the Balboa BART is about a 10-15 min walk (or a short ride on the 29, 54 or K).\n\nCity College is just a few blocks away, and SF State is also walking distance or a short ride on the 29 bus. Ocean Ave is two blocks away, with many restaurants, shops and services.\n\nDownstairs Bedroom: $750 mo. The bedroom is 8X14 feet, carpeted with a large window overlooking the backyard and garden. It is located in the very back of the house.\n\nThe house has WIFI. Satellite DISH TV for the room is also available but must be installed. Otherwise, all utilities (water, garbage, PG&E) would be split four ways. The amount fluctuates but it generally comes to around $100-$150 a month per person.\n\nThe Roommates: Three people, one guy and two women. We've lived in the house for over ten years, so the situation is very stable. We are pretty laid back in most ways. One of us is a special education teacher/writer who also hikes; one is an executive and musician and consultant, and one is a student at SFSU.\n\nWe are a little more on the clean than the messy side. We do all clean up after ourselves (do our dishes right away and don't leave them in the room for days).We do have a TV in the main living room but watch only movies and stuff on DVD for the most part. We do not watch network TV. The living-room is primarily our space. We all drink a little--some more than others--and other recreation is fine too. No hard drugs. We do have some limited smoking in well ventilated areas a couple times a week at designated times.\n\nWe're a creative household, with people who like to read a lot, watch movies, make art and have thought-provoking discussions. We're fairly musical too; we've got three guitars and a ukulele. But don't worry--it's all acoustic and the house is big enough so you don't hear each other playing.\n\nNo Lease needed. $200.00 deposit. Move in is first and last and deposit which comes to $1700.00. Sorry, no cats or dogs. Fish are okay we have three now.\n\nSo, if this sounds good and you are laid back and cool and can make your rent, please contact us!\n\nThe roommate is in the process of moving now so the room may be a little messy.\n\nThanks.

Fully stocked kitchen with a Breville Espresso maker / Baratza grinder, All-Clad cookery, etc.\nEasy commute downtown (38 Geary a short walk), easy drive to the Peninsula (near the highway).\nTerm: Shorter-term is fine with me. Longer-term too.\nMe:\nI do the right thing even when inconvenient, believe in being good to one another, and genuinely want to make it a wonderful experience for you. To that end, your room will come with fully prepared with a bed, a new Sealy hybrid mattress and protector, a tv - and, if you need them, a down comforter, high quality Italian linens, towels, etc. (This bedroom was to be a guest room originally, but it\'s never had the chance to host anyone). I\'m tidy - though I know everyone says this; considerate; understand when to interact and when to co-exist.\nRent:\nDepending on your situation, how often you\'re here, etc. I\'m an amenable person who is easy to compromise. Despite the rent being $3,700 (or $1850 each if split evenly), I\'m more looking for the right person than the right amount of money. $750-850-ish seems fair to me for 2-3 days per week if it also does to you.\nAny Catch?\nI\'d just like to live with a kind, ethical, considerate person. Likewise, you\'ll always get the same from me (I own my mistakes readily and am always focused on how to move forward, graciously).\nPlease, let\'s talk:\nI\'d like to verify you as a real person. Chat on the phone. Get a sense for who we are, how we\'ll amplify one another positively. If you made it this far, please mention \'unicorns\' or \'hot cocoa\'. I don\'t expect everyone to wade through this, but it\'s nice to know who does/doesn\'t :)\nAnd if you have it, would you please link your LinkedIn? This is a great way to weed-out the silliness and scams that accompany a post like this. I understand that sharing personal info exposes you as well, so please feel free to wait until we\'ve gone back-forth.\nIn any case, best of luck in your search!

Six month lease preferred, but can be flexible.\n\n\nAbout the Flat...\n\n\nIt\'s pretty nice. It\'s a flat in a San Francisco row house in the Sunset. The house itself has clean wall to wall carpet, high ceilings, sky lights, lots of windows and light, and a large balcony.\n\nThere\'s a backyard/patio, and we have access to a bit of earth here as well. Do you like to garden? The patio where the garden is located is actually quite large and great for BBQ\'s. There is a coin op. private laundry room on site for our convenience.Wireless internet.\n\nIt\'s got a beautiful kitchen --tile counter-tops, lots of kitchen storage--and get this--a dishwasher. For some reason I\'ve found that the inclusion of a dishwasher in a house makes living with your roommates 100 times easier by default.\n\nAs for street parking if you have a car, my roommates have never had to park more than two blocks from the house. With the exception of when that free Dave Matthews concert was playing in the park next door back in 04--that was a hassle. Other than that... Did I mention that we\'re half a block from Golden Gate Park? Easy access to SFSU. Or that the N-Judah is a block and a half away, and both the 7 and 29 are on the corner? Or that there are five family-run groceries, four banks, a post office, drug store, a marijuana dispensary, three hardware/house ware stores all within four blocks of the house, so you really don\'t even NEED a car, if you don\'t have one?\n\nThe neighborhood...\n\nis pretty funky. It\'s got a over a dozen funny little ethnic restaurants, the highlights being a Japanese Ramen-ya, three places for really good take-away sushi,three busy Dim Sum take-out shops, two extremely excellent Thai restaurants, a four cheap-as-dirt but tasty-as-hell Pho joint, Viet sammie joint, seven BOBA spots and donut joint. It\'s a cheap food paradise. The neighborhood is diverse. I really enjoy it here.\n\nThe people...\n\nright now we\'ve got an Ethnic Studies major, Photography major, Gerentology major, and a chef from Japan. We have a young household but a mature one. We work and study hard. We are fairly private, and there is room for the "family" enviornment if that suits your fancy, but no qualms for those who wish to be left alone.\n\nThe room...\n\nis a converted living room 13X14, so the idea here is modest and efficient. It\'s curtained off for privacy, the entrance is also curtained but no physical door hence the savings in price. We were originally going to make this a large sitting room but we figured it\'s better used as another room, since we really don\'t need a living room. It has a decent sized closet, and a window for morning sun, daylight, and breeze. Come check it out.\n\nThe living situation is chill: clean up your junk, but don\'t be anal. It\'s nice to clean the bathroom once in a while (I\'m guilty neglecting this chore), \'cause everyone uses it, and it\'s not cool to leave rotting food in the sink, \'cause nobody like that. But you\'re not going to be swiffering the parquet every five seconds or you\'re going to get a funny look. You might get another funny look if you walk around only your bra or boxers.\n\nAnd now you...\n\nHopefully you are financially secure, or at the very least, responsible enough to pay $550 rent and keep up with your share of chores. It\'s cool if you have a job, it\'s cool if you\'re livin off inheritance, it\'s not cool if you\'re a lazy moron.\n\n\nSchedules in the house vary--9-5ers + students remember? The general rule has been to keep the volume to a min. during week nights, and catch folks when you can to talk with them. Partying in your room is ok, friends coming over are cool, but respect folks who have finals.\n\nSexual orientation is not a big deal. We are what I call "open minded," and it is San Francisco so you should be, too. We\'re cool with drinking some wine or beer, medicating herbally as it were, but don\'t be an alcoholic or stoned 24/7. FYI it\'s no tobacco smoking indoors, and our beloved Chinchilla is the only pet permitted.\n\nI guess the theme here is we need someone chill, reasonably polite, certainly friendly, able to pay $550 a month, and relatively liberal.\n\nPlease drop us an email at the anonymous craigslist address, ask us some specific questions, and/or give us your phone number or ask us to call you.

Please remember, I am not looking for a room in a shared living situation. Thanks for keeping that in mind when you write or call!\n\nI am a working interpreter who speaks fluent Spanish, French, and German. I'm launching a language company online, and am looking to be in the Bay Area to meet with tech clients if necessary.\n\nBefore covid, I was spending my weeknights in hotels all over the state, as I worked mostly for the courts. I am currently selling the sailboat in Long Beach I would spend weekends on.\n\nThis arrangement made sense when I used to appear in person in the California courts nearly every weekday, since it avoided wasting money on an expensive apartment I wouldn't even have the chance to enjoy very often.\n\nNow, however, I am looking to find an apartment, house, or other such dwelling somewhere within ten miles of San Francisco, or in the City itself.\n\nI am open to housesitting, subletting, or other such arrangements. Since covid is real, however, I do want to avoid sharing a space with others. Nothing against other humans, but I really do want to minimize my covid chances. Living in the bay for me, therefore, means not sharing a living space.\n\nI have housesat before, and taken very good care of the places I inhabited. If you're looking for a responsible person to take care of your pets, garden, home, or other things of importance, I am a great choice.\n\nIf you have a respectable space that I could occupy without sharing air with other humans, I would be very grateful to hear from you!\n\nI have a car and would greatly appreciate a way to park the car without having to worry about breakins if at all possible.\n\nI can pay for a space, but would like to keep my housing costs to a minimum. Craigslist and housing rental sites list studios and larger for around $1000 per month. I have a feeling I can find a lower cost option that will be better for someone who needs a good housesitter or tenant like me, so I'm posting this in the hopes of making that connection.\n\nThank you very very much for considering this ad!\n\nI am very happy to speak with you on the phone if that is helpful.\nshow contact info .\n\nNick"}, {'price': '$850', 'email': 'c112319145ea31879f8e136421c090b2@hous.craigslist.org', 'description': "Need 1 person only.\n\nThis is truly an awesome apartment, honestly!

The house itself is quite large for SF... it has 3 floors including the garage on the ground floor, 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. There is a washer/dryer in the garage that all are welcomed to use. The common spaces are a large living room on the first floor, a large living room on the second floor, a backyard + a kitchen and dining room. There is also built in roof access, everyone is welcomed to use the common areas. Parking within a block of the house is almost always easy... except for a few weekends when there are big events in the neighborhood (a.k.a Outside Lands, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass) We do have 1 driveway space that you can use, it\'s first come first served for the roomates that live in the house.\n\nThe Roomates:\n\nAt this point there are 2 guys in their mid 30\'s living here. One works in the restaurant industry and the other works in tech. Both of us are pretty laid back, responsible and easy going. We both have our own lives / our own thing going on and we\'re both pretty busy, but we\'re friendly around the house and will often catch up while cooking dinner or whatever. One of use will usually spend ~3 nights at his girlfriend\'s house.\n\nWe don\'t have have a strong preference on who moves in terms of male/female, historically there have been mostly guys that have lived here... but if there is a girl that turns out to be the right fit who doesn\'t mind living w guys we\'re open to that.\n\nVibe of the House:\n\nI\'ve been living here for 8 years and it has never been a "party" house. This is to say that if you want to have all night ragers at the house until the sun comes up... this is not the place for you. However if you want to party all night outside of the house, by all means go ahead. That said, it\'s totally fine to have friends and gatherings here we just want to be reasonable + respectful about it... there have been a few Friday night / Sat Night parties here over the years and usually we make them end up around midnight.\n\nSeeing the place:\n\nIf you are interested in seeing the place we\'re going to be showing it by appointment this week. Go ahead and respond to the ad telling us a little bit about yourself and your situation.\n\nThe Landlord:\n\nIf things seem like a fit with us and you the next step would be to get the landlord involved. Part of the deal here is that the landlord needs to approve new tenants moving in, this means things like proof of employment (or other means to pay rent) a credit check, and potentially providing other financial info. We realize that it is a lot to ask, and isn\'t normal... but this is the way the land lord does things, it\'s beyond our control. If you have decent credit and means to pay rent it shouldn\'t be a problem.\n\n\nNote: The room itself is not in the pictures because someone is still living in it up until 8/15, it is available to see in person now though.'}, {'price': '', 'email': '160a62facd4c36d691c08227372c7371@hous.craigslist.org', 'description': 'Family of 3 seeks 2 or 3 bedroom home within 45 minute commute of Sausalito, prefer SF or East Bay.

I live in the Tahoe area and will be commuting down to SF to work 3-4 day/night stretches. I will be working around 6 to 8 shifts a month. I am in search of a room that I will be able to sleep and shower in while in SF for work. I work 12 hour shifts so my stays in SF will be primarily me working and sleeping. I will be working night shift which means I will be gone from 1900 to 0700. I am looking for a quiet room. I will really be of no bother to you and I do not need extravagant amenities. Access to a shower and bed is all I need. Ideally I want to save as much money as possible to make working in SF worthwhile. I am willing to negotiate for a nightly rate or a flat even rate depending on how many nights days I will be staying. I should know my schedule at least 1 month in advance as well to better notify you of potential time slots I would want to rent the room.\n\nA little about me...I worked at SF General full time for 2 years in the past and I am excited to return in this part time role. I recently moved full time to Tahoe area to shred pow all winter and swim in alpine lakes all summer. I am from the bay area and look forward to maintaining my ties to the community of San Francisco.\n\nAnyway, hit me up if you have questions and think this will be a good fit to have some extra income from a person who will literally just be sleeping there and you may not even know I am there.'}, {'price': '$600', 'email': '0db36faa9570353293483f5c6eaa616b@hous.craigslist.org', 'description': "$ 600 for monthly rent plus $ 100 for all utilities and all other monthly expenses equals $ 700 total cost per month.
